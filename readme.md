# Udacity Project: Neighborhood Map

Developed for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## What does it do?

This is the Udacity Neighborhood Map Project. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and provide further information services from Wikipedia. A street view image is also provided for each location.

Included is a list of well-know places in Berlin where I am living at the moment. The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. The marker icon even bounce like you expect them to. There's also extra info pulled from the Wikipedia API where available.

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using media queries. It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window! There is a button named menu that toggles the navigation sidebar.
